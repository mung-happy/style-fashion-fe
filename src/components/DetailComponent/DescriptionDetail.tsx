              The patented eighteen-inch hardwood Arrowhead deck --- finely
              mortised in, makes this the strongest and most rigid canoe ever
              built. You cannot buy a canoe that will afford greater
              satisfaction.

              The St. Louis Meramec Canoe Company was founded by Alfred Wickett
              in 1922. Wickett had previously worked for the Old Town Canoe Co
              from 1900 to 1914. Manufacturing of the classic wooden canoes in
              Valley Park, Missouri ceased in 1978.
